This is a quick project for personal use.

I want to keep track of consumable around my house and be able to ask what am I missing. Where should I buy different products depending on pricing etc.

I will use SQL for easy querries as well as nodejs to create a telegram bot so I can communicate from any supermarket through my phone.

To use, start a telegram chat with @BotFather which will help you create a bot and tweak privacy settings, but will also give you a link to start a chat with your new bot as well as a token for access. For now well store this token in "Other" folder in "token.txt". Now the bot can communicate with telegram and recieve requests.

This will be contained in docker for ease of use once finished
